# SauceDemo BDD Test Automation - Test Plan & Strategy

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive test plan and strategy for automating the SauceDemo e-commerce application using Behavior Driven Development (BDD) principles.

## 2. Testing Objectives
- Ensure all critical user journeys function correctly
- Validate UI interactions and navigation flows
- Verify data integrity throughout the application
- Provide rapid feedback on application quality
- Support continuous integration and deployment

## 3. Application Under Test
- **Application**: SauceDemo E-commerce Platform
- **URL**: https://www.saucedemo.com/
- **Type**: Web Application (E-commerce)

## 4. Test Scope

### 4.1 In Scope
- User Authentication (Login/Logout)
- Product Catalog Management
- Shopping Cart Operations
- Checkout Process
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Responsive design validation

### 4.2 Out of Scope
- Performance Testing
- Security Testing
- API Testing
- Database Testing
- Third-party Integrations

## 5. Testing Types

### 5.1 Functional Testing
- **Positive Testing**: Valid user workflows and expected behaviors
- **Negative Testing**: Invalid inputs, error handling, and edge cases
- **Boundary Testing**: Limits and constraints validation
- **Data Validation**: Input validation and data integrity

### 5.2 UI/UX Testing
- Element visibility and interaction
- Navigation flow validation
- Form validation and error messages
- Visual consistency across pages

### 5.3 Cross-browser Testing
- Chrome (Latest)
- Firefox (Latest)
- Edge (Latest)
- Safari (Latest - Manual validation)

### 5.4 Responsive Testing
- Desktop (1920x1080, 1366x768)
- Tablet (768x1024)
- Mobile (375x667, 414x896)

## 6. Tools and Technologies

### 6.1 Core Framework
- **Language**: Java 11+
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **Test Framework**: JUnit 5
- **BDD Framework**: Cucumber
- **WebDriver**: Selenium WebDriver 4.x
- **Driver Management**: WebDriverManager

### 6.2 Design Patterns
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Organized page representations
- **Dependency Injection**: PicoContainer for step definition management
- **Factory Pattern**: Driver initialization and management

### 6.3 Reporting and Monitoring
- **HTML Reports**: Cucumber built-in reporting
- **Enhanced Reports**: ExtentReports with screenshots
- **Screenshot Capture**: Automated on test failures

## 7. Test Environment Strategy

### 7.1 Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Local development testing
- **Staging**: Pre-production validation
- **Production**: Smoke testing only

### 7.2 Test Data Management
- Static test data for consistent results
- Environment-specific configuration files
- Parameterized test execution

## 8. Test Execution Strategy

### 8.1 Test Categories
- **@Smoke**: Critical path validation (15-20 tests)
- **@Regression**: Full feature coverage (50+ tests)
- **@NegativeTest**: Error handling validation
- **@Integration**: End-to-end workflows

### 8.2 Execution Approach
- **Sequential Execution**: Default mode for stability
- **Parallel Execution**: Configurable for faster feedback
- **Cross-browser Execution**: Matrix-based testing
- **Scheduled Execution**: Nightly regression runs

## 9. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### 9.1 Technical Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Browser compatibility issues | High | Medium | Multi-browser testing strategy |
| Element locator changes | Medium | High | Robust locator strategies, maintenance processes |
| Test data dependencies | Medium | Low | Independent test scenarios, data cleanup |
| Infrastructure failures | High | Low | Retry mechanisms, alternative environments |

### 9.2 Business Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Critical bug in production | High | Low | Comprehensive smoke testing |
| Release delays due to test failures | Medium | Medium | Efficient test triage and parallel execution |
| False positives | Low | Medium | Regular test maintenance and review |

## 10. Maintenance Strategy

### 10.1 Test Maintenance
- Regular review of test scenarios (monthly)
- Locator strategy updates as needed
- Framework updates and dependency management
- Performance optimization

### 10.2 Reporting and Metrics
- Test execution trends
- Pass/fail rates by module
- Defect detection efficiency
- Test execution time analysis

## 11. Browser Compatibility Matrix

| Browser | Version | Desktop | Mobile | Priority |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| Chrome | Latest 2 versions | ✓ | ✓ | High |
| Firefox | Latest 2 versions | ✓ | ✓ | High |
| Edge | Latest 2 versions | ✓ | ✓ | Medium |
| Safari | Latest version | ✓ | ✓ | Medium |

## 12. Success Criteria
